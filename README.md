# two-intrinsic-symmetry-detection-methods
This repository explores two advanced intrinsic symmetry detection methods for CENG589 Digital Geometry Processing course in METU. This repo. contains C++ implementations and study of two academic approaches: "Global Intrinsic Symmetries of Shapes" (Ovsjanikov et al.) and "MÃ¶bius Transformations For Global Intrinsic Symmetry Analysis" (Kim et al.).
